# 8-Puzzle-Algorithm-Comparison-AI-Project
This project compares various search algorithms for solving the classic 8-puzzle problem. The algorithms used in this project include:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search (A* with different heuristics)

The goal is to find the optimal solution to the 8-puzzle problem by rearranging tiles to match the target state using the least number of moves, memory, and time.

## Problem Description
The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The goal is to move the tiles either horizontally or vertically to reach the goal state:
